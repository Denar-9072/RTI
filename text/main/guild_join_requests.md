We don't add people to our in-game guild automatically after approving their applications. You also DON'T need to be in the in-game guild to join our raids. However, the in-game guild is open to everyone who is interested. Remember that you need the @Member role in this Discord to be able to use this channel. (check #join_us)
`-------------------------------------------------`
**Why you should join the in-game guild:**
`[•]` Active guild chat where you can ask questions, look for people for your group, or just chat.
`[•]` A fully upgraded guild hall.
`[•]` Official guild messages to keep you up to date.
`[•]` The ability to rep RTI to help spread the word.
`[•]` More opportunities to get into raids.
`-------------------------------------------------`
Type `join` here if you want to get added to the in-game guild!
**NOTE**: If your message is still in this channel, then it will be handled. DO NOT send duplicate messages!
**DISCLAIMER**: We reserve the right to remove you from the in-game guild if you act like a toxic scumbag to others while repping RTI, even if they aren't RTI members.
