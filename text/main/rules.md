```diff
- Rule [1]: Respect others
We encourage joking around and friendly humour but not toxicity, frustration, inappropriate behaviour, and name-shaming. To veterans in particular, do not berate new players and trainees - remember that we were all new once.
```
```diff
- Rule [2]: Don't be inappropriate
There will be no racism, sexism, hate speech, dark humour, NSFW/NSFL, or similar unbecoming content in the Discord, TeamSpeak, guild chat, or RTI-organised runs. Moderators may deem messages as unbecoming or inappropriate at their own discretion.
```
```diff
- Rule [3]: Keep it to DMs
Any personal feuds or "drama" between guild members should be moved to direct messages or whispers or brought to the attention of an officer.
```
```diff
- Rule [4]: Accept and deliver criticism fairly
Try to be open to constructive criticism and willing to improve your gameplay. On the flip side, criticism you dish out should be constructive and helpful.
```
```diff
- Rule [5]: Follow the Guild Wars 2 rules
We expect all of our members to follow the Guild Wars 2 user agreement and code of conduct while in-game.
```
```diff
- Rule [6]: Don't commit cyber crime
Do not engage in illegal or counterfeit activities through our chat channels. This includes fraud, cyber bullying, sharing computer viruses, piracy, phishing, identity theft, etc.
```
```diff
- Rule [7]: No LI/KP requirements
The whole point of this guild is to help new players raid. Keep LI and KP requirements out of the guild chat or this Discord. The only exception we make to this rule is when you are in a pug group unrelated to RTI that set their own requirements, in which case this must be clearly stated. Note that asking for experience or knowledge of a fight is permissible.
```
```diff
- Rule [8]: Don't spam
Spam includes posting the same or similar messages multiple times, pinging people unnecessarily, etc. In addition, if you have the privileges, do not abuse @everyone and @here. Excessive usage will result in a ban or revoking of your privileges.
```
```diff
- Rule [9]: Be punctual
If you sign up for a raid, we expect you to show up and stay for the specified duration of the raid. If you learn that you can't make, unregister! It is also considered a courtesy to let the commander of the run know if you have to drop out.
```
```diff
- Rule [10]: Do not misspell "Qadim"
It's spelled "Qadim". Not "Quadim". Seriously.
