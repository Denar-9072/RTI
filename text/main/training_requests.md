This is a channel you can use to request wings or bosses to be trained on.
`-------------------------------------------------`
**How does it work?**
Post a message in here saying which wings or bosses you want a training for. Remember that you need the @Member role in this Discord to be able to use this channel. (check #join_us)
**Example**: "Wing 5 training please. Can play DPS or Druid but don't want to push or kite. I can't make Sunday."
Afterwards, one of the commanders MAY post a training in a private channel, allow you to see it before everyone else, and ping you. You will have some advance notice to sign up before it is made public.
Every Monday, the requests in this channel are purged. If your request was not accommodated in time, then feel free to post it again.
`-------------------------------------------------`
**Rules**
`[•]` Include what class(es) you play and which evenings you CAN'T make it on (if any).
`[•]` You can request a maximum of one training per week.
`[•]` You can only request trainings if you **don't** have your first kill on at least one of the bosses in each of the wing(s) you request. This is not a place to ask for trainings so you can learn specific roles or farm KP.
`[•]` We don't take requests for CMs or fractal/dungeon runs.
`[•]` If you don't need the training anymore, please delete your request.
**MAKE SURE YOU FOLLOW THESE RULES OR YOUR REQUEST MAY BE IGNORED.**
`-------------------------------------------------`
**DISCLAIMER**: Please appreciate that pleasing everyone is not an easy task. There is no guarantee that your request will be accommodated. Commanders will look at this channel occasionally to see whom they can reserve spots for in their raids, but this depends very much on commanders' availability and discretion.
