This is a channel you can use to request wings or bosses to be trained on.
`-------------------------------------------------`
**How does it work?**
Press the :white_check_mark: below to make a request for raid trainings. The bot will DM you with simple instructions to follow.
`-------------------------------------------------`
**Notes**
`[•]` You need to give @RtiBot#4883 your API key. If you haven't already, you will be asked for it when making a request.
`[•]` You need the @Member role in this Discord to be able to use this service. (check join_us)
`[•]` You can only request trainings if you *don't* have your first kill on at least one of the bosses in each of the wing(s) you request. If you have killed all the bosses of a wing you requested at least once, then the wing gets automatically removed from the request.
`[•]` Please be courteous to others and do not join multiple trainings of the same wing in a week, even if you get invited for both of them via your training request.
`[•]` You can update :white_check_mark: or delete :x: your request at any point.
`[•]` You must have DMs turned on in this server (right-click server icon -> Privacy Settings).
`[•]` If you have any troubles, contact an @Officer.

**DISCLAIMER**: Please appreciate that pleasing everyone is not an easy task. There is no guarantee that your request will be accommodated in a timely manner!
