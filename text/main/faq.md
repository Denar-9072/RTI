`[1] How do I join your raids?`
First, join our community (i.e. get the **Member** role on Discord)! Read the #welcome channel and follow our requirements before applying. Follow this guide to get a full overview of what you need to do to get started:
https://tinyurl.com/rtiquickstart
_ _
`[2] When do you normally raid?`
Training runs can take place on any day and time of the week (often at `20:00 CET/CEST (GMT+1/2)`). The only expectation is that, once signed up, you commit yourself to the duration of the raid (usually 2 - 3 hours).
Our timezones are CET and CEST, depending on whether or not we're in the summer period and daylight savings is active.
<https://time.is/CET>
<https://time.is/CEST>

`[3] How do I sign up for a raid?`
Once you have joined RTI and received the **Member** role, you can sign up for our raids with our Discord bot, @RtiBot#4883! Raids organised using the bot will show up in the `CURRENT RAIDS` category of our Discord as separate channels, with a :large_blue_diamond: near the channel name if there are spots and a :red_circle: near the channel name if the raid is full. Note that a full raid doesn't necessarily mean you can't sign up - feel free to take a reserve spot and you will get notified if a spot opens up!

To sign up for any raid, simply click the :pencil: reaction underneath the post in the raid's channel. You will then get a DM from the bot asking you what you want to sign up as, and all you need to do is send it the correct number. You can sign up for the reserve role you want to fill (e.g. :green_circle: **Druid**) and get notified if that specific spot opens up, or you can choose to sign up as :jigsaw: **Multiclass** and get notified if any spot opens up.

You will get a message from @RtiBot#4883 an hour before the raid is starting and there is also a time at the bottom of each of our raid embeds (the `Your Time` footer) which converts the raid's scheduled time to your timezone. If you're still unsure, hit the :clipboard: in #ðŸ“…raid_schedule to get a countdown for each raid you've signed up to!

Ensure that you have DMs turned on for this server or else the bot won't be able to contact you! You can turn them on from the server's privacy settings, which you can find by right-clicking on the RTI server icon in your Discord.

Note that if you still need your first ever raid kills on some bosses, you can even request a training in #training_requests and you'll get priority to join!
_ _
`[4] Can I sign up for any raid?`
As a general rule of thumb, always read the raid description. That being said, the raids we organise tend to fall under four categories:

`[â€¢]` **Training runs** comprise the majority of our raids and are open to everyone. You do not need to have any experience or knowledge of the fight, since everything will be explained and we are very tolerant to mistakes, but watching a video or reading a guide is usually a good idea and sometimes specified in the description. If you join as DPS, a common requirement is that you have a power AND condi DPS build ready for certain wings.
`[â€¢]` **Continuation runs** are continuations of previous raids where priority is given to those who joined the previous time. These are often needed for extra difficult wings/bosses where getting it down in one night isn't always possible.
`[â€¢]` **Kill runs** are generally made with the intent of getting a number of bosses or wings down. These are regular LFG raids that require experience with the fights and will not include explanations. While KP/LI requirements will never be present, you are expected to join these raids with a decent level of comfort and familiarity with the boss and your class.
`[â€¢]` **CM runs** are progression on certain raid challenge motes, which are essentially more difficult versions of raid bosses. For these, familiarity with the normal-mode version of the boss(es) is almost always required.
_ _
`[5] Do I need to be able to talk on Discord voice chat?`
You must be able to listen during an RTI run (hearing impairments notwithstanding). Talking is not required but is encouraged.
_ _
`[6] Do I need to be in the in-game guild to join your raids?`
No! You can join our raids without being in our in-game guild. However, if you want a spot in the in-game guild, check out #guild_join_requests.
_ _
`[7] What is a raid-ready character?`
This is not easy to define, but for us, we consider a character raid-ready when:
`[â€¢]` It follows a meta build (see <https://snowcrows.com/> for meta builds you can choose from).
`[â€¢]` It has the right gear stats, runes, and sigils.
`[â€¢]` You understand how to play your class and have looked through and practised the skill rotation on your build's Snow Crows page.
_ _
`[8] Can I run my own homebrew offmeta build?`
Our default stance is no; we expect you to bring a character with a meta build into our training runs. You can easily check what the meta builds are from the Snow Crows website: <https://snowcrows.com/>

Be aware that if you are returning to the game after a break, the builds you may be familiar with are probably no longer in use, and/or their gear may have changed significantly. Having only recently returned to the game is not an acceptable excuse to run an out-of-date build in training runs when you can easily check through Snow Crows or simply ask in #general chat.

If you wish to use anything else, please ask the commander running the event, prior to signing up.
_ _
`[9] Do I need full ascended gear to join or raid with you?`
We do not carry out gear checks by default, and it is not necessary to have full ascended gear. However, we want you to be realistic about what an acceptable standard of gear is to have, bearing in mind that if you use subpar gear, you not only make the run more difficult for yourself but also for the 9 other people in the squad.

Ascended weapons can make a significant difference to your DPS as their weapon strength is 5% higher than their exotic counterparts. Trinkets provide the majority of your stats and are trivially easy to get through the Living World and story achievements. Ascended armour is the most expensive and has the least impact, so we understand that some players will use exotic armor temporarily. Stat infusons are an extremely minor stat increase and are not required (or recommended to farm for at any early stage of raiding).

We do not think it is too much to ask that you at least have ascended weapons and trinkets. It goes without saying that we also expect you to use the correct prefixes, sigils and runes for your role and that we expect you to use the correct food/utility. Check with the commander running the event if you wish to use a cheaper/weaker variant.
_ _
`[10] What build should I run?`
We want to encourage players to build up a variety of roles they can perform. Having more increases your desirability in raids and gives you more opportunities, as well as just improving your understanding of each encounter.

:chronomancer: **Chronomancers** (support) are always in short supply. Niche builds, such as Hand Kiter on :deimos: **Deimos**, are also far and few between. Healers, especially :druid: **Druid** and :firebrand: **Firebrand**, are always a good idea to have in any raider's arsenal.

Players that try to stick to pure DPS should also have options between power-based DPS and condition-based DPS, including DPS roles which are more effective on bosses with unusual circumstances (e.g. if we're on :largos: **Largos**, a class that is good for moving targets that attack often such as Condition :mirage: **Mirage** / :chronomancer: **Chronomancer** is extremely helpful).

In #class_guides we talk a bit more about some builds you can run and what we usually take into RTI trainings.
_ _
`[11] Do I need to rep RTI or be an active member?`
There are no requirements on representing or even joining the in-game guild. There is also no requirement to be active to remain a member of RTI, but do note that we regularly clear out inactive members (i.e. people who have not logged into the game for a while) from our in-game guild.
_ _
`[12] I messed up and received a warning! What does this mean?`
Sometimes you might, consciously or subconsciously, fail to follow one of our #rules, especially **Rule #5** which is our most commonly broken rule that includes the following infractions:
a) Not showing up for a raid.
b) Showing up but leaving earlier than the specified duration.
c) Unregistering from a raid within 30 minutes before it starts.
d) Showing up to a raid unprepared (e.g. description of a :dhuum: **Dhuum** training asked for experience with the "greens" mechanic and you had no experience).

We take this stuff seriously! All of the above infractions and other offences that are covered in the #rules channel can cause minor inconveniences at best and downtime, stress, or drama at worst. If you do break our rules, you will receive an anonymous warning from our officers letting you know what the issue was. Of course, we tend to be lenient with these, i.e. you shouldn't get warned for a power cut that caused you to leave a raid early, for instance, but you will get warned if, say, you forgot you signed up for a raid and didn't show up. Communicating such issues with the leader of the raid is paramount!

Each warning is saved into our system, and you get temporarily banned from joining RTI raids (and kicked from any raids you're currently in) if you hit three* warnings. If you then hit six* warnings, you'll get temporarily banned for a longer period. On the extreme case that you hit nine* warnings, you will be permanently banned from RTI raids and from our Discord server.

* Note that we always ban on a case-by-case basis, so these numbers aren't set in stone.

`[13] What are the bots that I see people sending commands to?`
Read the #bot_spam channel's description to get an overview of each Discord bot that we use.
_ _
`[14] What is an API key? How and why should I use it?`
An API key is a identifier unique to your GW2 account that allows the bots to access information related to your account, such as the names of your characters, what raid bosses you've killed, and a whole host of other info. Two of our bots currently use API keys: @GW2Bot#2251 and @RtiBot#4883.

@GW2Bot#2251 is the most popular Discord bot for GW2 that allows you to get all sorts of information, such as which raid bosses you have yet to kill this week (type `$bosses`), how much LI/KP you have (type `$kp`), where certain items are on your account (type `$search <item-name>`), etc. @RtiBot#4883 is our in-house bot that we use to organise raids and manage applications, and we use API keys to figure out which raids you have never done on your account, which can allow you to have priority to join raids we organise in the future. You can add your API key to the bots from here:
`[â€¢]` Log into your account here: <http://account.arena.net/applications>
`[â€¢]` Create an API Key by clicking `New Key`.
`[â€¢]` Check the permissions that you will give it. Permissions that you will want to tick for our bots are: `inventories`, `characters`, `wallet`, `progressions`, and `guilds`
`[â€¢]` Once you have created the key, copy it, and then go into #bot_spam and type `$key add ####` (replace the hashtags with your key) to add it to GW2-Bot and `&keyadd ####` to add it to RTI-Bot.
_ _
`[15] What are all the different Discord ranks?`
`[â€¢]` **Member**
Your rank upon joining the community. You need this rank to join our raids!
_Requirements_: #rules
`[â€¢]` **Lieutenant**
Lieutenants help out in training runs and organise kill runs, CM runs, fractals, and dungeons. They have good knowledge of most encounters and have experience within raids.
_Requirements_: #become_a_commander
`[â€¢]` **Commander**
Commanders lead training runs on a regular basis (at least once per month). They have good knowledge of all encounters and many class builds. They will also be socially active in the guild and keen to help out new players.
_Requirements_: #become_a_commander
`[â€¢]` **Officer**
Officers enforce guild discipline, handle guild admin, and are involved in overarching changes to how RTI and the discord work.
_Requirements_: Approved by @Leader.
`[â€¢]` **Hero, Zero to Hero, Sidekick**
These roles are part of the "Zero to Hero" initiative where temporary raid statics are made for new raiders and all raid wings are completed with close guidance by (an) experienced raid leader(s). This initiative is announced in #announcements every few months.
_Requirements_: Show interest in the initiative when it is announced.
_ _
`[16] Whom do I speak to if I have an issue with another member?`
Speak to an @Officer. Screenshots of the (entire) conversation, if it happened in game, are immensely useful. Any action taken will depend upon the severity of the transgression.
_ _
`[17] Can anyone organise a raid / training run?`
Anyone is allowed to post an LFG in the #lfg channel by pinging the LFG role. We do, however, have an important rule: You cannot ask for LI or kill proof in these channels, unless it is not an RTI run (e.g. the PUG you are in - which you are currently not leading - is looking for more people).

If you're interested in organising official raids with the guild on a regular basis, especially training runs, then please contact an @Officer and we can talk about giving you the @Commander role.

If you want to help out in our raid trainings and/or organise your own kill runs, CMs, dungeons, or fractals, contact an @Officer and we can talk about giving you the @Lieutenant role. This is a good stepping stone towards becoming a commander!

More info is given in the #become_a_commander channel!

`[18] RTI raids fill up too quickly! What do I do?`
It is difficult to get into raid trainings, but here are some tips to give you better chances of getting into raids with us:
`[â€¢]` Have your ping notifications turned on for this server. We ping people every time a new official raid is published. Be sure to go to #ping_settings and opt in to additional ping roles for even more opportunities!
`[â€¢]` Sign up as reserve for runs you didn't get into on time. We regularly ping all reserves of a raid if a spot opens up.
`[â€¢]` Join the in-game guild via #guild_join_requests. Runs are advertised there on a regular basis.
`[â€¢]` Be as multiclass as you can. Gearing roles such as :chronomancer: **Support/Tank Chronomancer**, :firebrand: **Heal Firebrand**, :renegade: **Alacrity Renegade**, and :druid: **Druid** makes it much easier to get spots in our runs, as they are in far more demand than DPS.
`[â€¢]` If you still need your first kills on certain bosses, then request a raid training in #training_requests and you may get a spot reserved for you in a future raid!
`[â€¢]` If you want to practise specific roles on specific wings/bosses, then make a request in #special_role_requests and you may get a spot reserved for you in a future raid!
_ _
`[19] I have <insert disability here>. Am I still able to raid with you?`
Yes! Sometimes we get people joining with certain disabilities, such as hearing impairments, colour blindness, learning disorders, physical disabilities, etc. This often can make it more daunting to join training raids.

Don't feel ashamed to let us know if you need us to make any accommodations. We are happy to make some changes to how we do things, such as giving you one-on-one sessions to help you with certain challenges, having someone transcribe what the commander is saying on voice chat to you in typing, or at the very least exercising a level of understanding of your situation if we notice you struggling with certain things.

The important thing is that you let the commander of the raid you're joining know in advance so that we are able to make these accommodations!
