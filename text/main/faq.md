`[1] How do I join your raids?`
First, join our community! Read the #join_us channel and follow our requirements before applying.
_ _
`[2] When do you normally raid?`
Training runs can take place on any day and time of the week (often at `20:00 CET/CEST (GMT+1/2)`). The only expectation is that, once signed up, you commit yourself to the duration of the raid (usually 2 - 3 hours).
_ _
`[3] How do I sign up for a raid?`
Once you have joined the guild, you can sign up for our raids with our Discord bot, @RtiBot#4883! Raids organised using the bot will show up in the `CURRENT RAIDS` category of our Discord as separate channels. To sign up for them, simply click the :pencil: icon underneath the post in the channel. You will then get a DM from the bot asking you what you want to sign up as, and all you need to do is send it the correct number.

Ensure that you have DMs turned on for this server or else the bot won't be able to contact you! You can turn them on from the server's privacy settings, which you can find by right-clicking on the RTI server icon in your Discord.

`[4] Can I sign up for any raid?`
As a general rule of thumb, always read the raid description. That being said, the raids we organise tend to fall under four categories:

`[•]` **Training runs** comprise the majority of our raids and are open to everyone. You do not need to have any experience or knowledge of the fight, since everything will be explained and we are very tolerant to mistakes, but watching a video or reading a guide is usually a good idea and sometimes specified in the description. If you join as DPS, a common requirement is that you have a power AND condi DPS build ready for certain wings.
`[•]` **Continuation runs** are continuations of previous raids where priority is given to those who joined the previous time. These are often needed for extra difficult wings/bosses where getting it down in one night isn't always possible.
`[•]` **Kill runs** are generally made with the intent of getting a number of bosses or wings down. These are regular LFG raids that require experience with the fights and will not include explanations. While KP/LI requirements will never be present, you are expected to join these raids with a decent level of comfort and familiarity with the boss and your class.
`[•]` **CM runs** are progression on certain raid challenge motes, which are essentially more difficult versions of raid bosses. For these, familiarity with the normal-mode version of the boss(es) is almost always required.
_ _
`[5] Do I need to be able to talk on Discord/Teamspeak?`
You must be able to listen during an RTI run. Talking is not required but is encouraged.
_ _
`[6] Do I need to be in the in-game guild to join your raids?`
No! You can join our raids without being in our in-game guild. However, if you want to be part of the guild, check out #guild_join_requests.
_ _
`[7] Can I run my own homebrew offmeta build?`
Our default stance is no; we expect you to bring a character with a meta build into our training runs. You can easily check what the meta builds are from the Snow Crows website: <https://snowcrows.com/>

Be aware that if you are returning to the game after a break, the builds you may be familiar with are probably no longer in use, and/or their gear may have changed significantly. Having only recently returned to the game is not an acceptable excuse to run an out-of-date build in training runs when you can easily check through Snow Crows or simply ask in #general chat.

If you wish to use anything else, please ask the commander running the event, prior to signing up.
_ _
`[8] Do I need full ascended gear to join or raid with you?`
We do not carry out gear checks by default, and it is not necessary to have full ascended gear. However, we want you to be realistic about what an acceptable standard of gear is to have, bearing in mind that if you use subpar gear, you not only make the run more difficult for yourself but also for the 9 other people in the squad.

Ascended weapons can make a significant difference to your DPS as their weapon strength is 5% higher than their exotic counterparts. Trinkets provide the majority of your stats and are trivially easy to get through the Living World and story achievements. Ascended armour is the most expensive and has the least impact, so we understand that some players will use exotic armor temporarily. Stat infusons are an extremely minor stat increase and are not required (or recommended to farm for at any early stage of raiding).

We do not think it is too much to ask that you at least have ascended weapons and trinkets. It goes without saying that we also expect you to use the correct prefixes, sigils and runes for your role and that we expect you to use the correct food/utility. Check with the commander running the event if you wish to use a cheaper/weaker variant.
_ _
`[9] What build should I run?`
We want to encourage players to build up a variety of roles they can perform. Having more increases your desirability in raids and gives you more opportunities, as well as just improving your understanding of each encounter.

Chronomancers (support) are always in short supply. Niche builds, such as hand kiter on Deimos, are also far and few between. Healers, especially druid and renegade, are always a good idea to have in any raider's arsenal.

Players that try to stick to pure DPS should also have options between power-based DPS and condition-based DPS, including DPS roles which are more effective on bosses with unusual circumstances (e.g. if we're on Largos, a class that is good for moving targets that attack often such as condition Mirage/Chronomancer is extremely helpful).
_ _
`[10] Do I need to rep RTI?`
There are no requirements on repping this specific guild.
_ _
`[11] Do I need to be active?`
There is no requirement to be active to remain a member of RTI, but do note that we regularly clear out inactive members (i.e. people who have not logged into the game for a while) from our in-game guild.
_ _
`[12] What are the bots that I see people sending commands to?`
Read the #bot_spam channel's description to get an overview of each Discord bot that we use.
_ _
`[13] What is an API key? How and why should I use it?`
An API key is a identifier unique to your GW2 account that allows the bots to access information related to your account, such as the names of your characters, what raid bosses you've killed, and a whole host of other info. Two of our bots currently use API keys: @GW2Bot#2251 and @RtiBot#4883.

@GW2Bot#2251 is the most popular Discord bot for GW2 that allows you to get all sorts of information, such as which raid bosses you have yet to kill this week (type `$bosses`), how much LI/KP you have (type `$kp`), where certain items are on your account (type `$search <item-name>`), etc. @RtiBot#4883 is our in-house bot that we use to organise raids and manage applications, and we use API keys to figure out which raids you have never done on your account, which can allow you to have priority to join raids we organise in the future. You can add your API key to the bots from here:
`[•]` Log into your account here: <http://account.arena.net/applications>
`[•]` Create an API Key by clicking `New Key`.
`[•]` Check the permissions that you will give it. Permissions that you will want to tick for our bots are: `inventories`, `characters`, `wallet`, `progressions`, and `guilds`
`[•]` Once you have created the key, copy it, and then go into #bot_spam and type `$key add ####` (replace the hashtags with your key) to add it to GW2-Bot and `&keyadd ####` to add it to RTI-Bot.
_ _
`[14] What are all the different Discord ranks?`
`[•]` **Member**
Your rank upon joining the community.
_Requirements_: #join_us 
`[•]` **Commander**
They help around on our trainings, leading or assisting. They have good knowledge of most encounters and class builds. They will also be socially active in the guild and keen to help out new players. 
_Requirements_: Approved by @Officer. Help out in at least 1 training per month.
`[•]` **Officer**
Enforces guild discipline and handles the admin.
_Requirements_: Approved by @Leader.
_ _
`[15] Whom do I speak to if I have an issue with another member?`
Speak to an @Officer. Screenshots of the (entire) conversation, if it happened in game, are immensely useful. Any action taken will depend upon the severity of the transgression.
_ _
`[16] Can anyone organise a raid / training run?`
Anyone is allowed to post an LFG in the #lfg channel by pinging the LFG role. We do, however, have an important rule: You cannot ask for LI or kill proof in these channels, unless it is not an RTI run (e.g. the PUG you are in - which you are currently not leading - is looking for more people).

If you're interested in organising official raids with the guild, especially training runs, then please contact an @Officer and we can talk about giving you the @Commander role.
