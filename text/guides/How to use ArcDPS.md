# How to use ArcDPS

## Basics

### What is ArcDPS?
ArcDPS is a DPS meter for Guild Wars 2 used by a huge portion of the raiding community. It's very simple to install and use, and all it does is overlay some unobtrusive windows above your game that you can move around, hide/show, and configure to your liking.

### Is it safe to use?
While there is no "official" approval, it was [approved by Chris Cleary, a former lead ArenaNet dev](https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/5svug8/the_head_of_the_snake_devs_here_ask_us_anything/ddi77u2/) in an old Reddit post. Many players are using it, recording footage with it visible, and openly talking about it on the official forums and subreddits. ArenaNet are very much aware of its existence and nobody has ever been banned for using it to our knowledge. Remember that in the end, it is a third-party tool, so nobody can claim it is 100% safe to use, but raiders have used this tool for years without hitches. Make of that what you will.

### How do I install ArcDPS?
Go to the [ArcDPS Website](https://www.deltaconnected.com/arcdps/), scroll down to [x64: Current](https://www.deltaconnected.com/arcdps/x64/), and click on `d3d9.dll`. Browse to your Guild Wars 2 installation directory (usually `C:/Program Files/Guild Wars 2`), go into your `bin64` directory, and save the `d3d9.dll` file in there.

If you ever want to update ArcDPS, you would also follow the above instructions and replace the old `dll` file with the new one. ArcDPS often breaks with new significant game updates and the developer of the DPS meter has to roll out a new update to ArcDPS, which is usually done within a day or two. The **changes** section of the official website will update when a new patch is out.

If you ever want to uninstall ArcDPS, you simply remove `d3d9.dll` from your directory.

Finally, if you run into issues getting it to work, the **its not working** section of the official website has some fixes you can try.
