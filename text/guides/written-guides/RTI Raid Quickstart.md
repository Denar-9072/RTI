# RTI Raid Quickstart
If you're on this page then you might be new to raids and looking to get into the game mode. This game mode has some of the most fun content that Guild Wars 2 has to offer, and this guide will show you how to get started with raiding with our guild!

## Preparing for Raids

### Gearing up:
1. Choose the class you wish to raid with. All classes in the game are viable with some build or other. Take a look at the `#class_guides` channel in the RTI Discord to get a better idea of what class to go for and what a typical RTI raid class composition looks like.

![Class Guides](https://i.imgur.com/tqA6Bup.png)

2. Choose a build to use for your class on [Snow Crows](https://www.snowcrows.com/). Builds broadly fall under categories of DPS (damage-oriented), boon support (giving important boons like quickness/might or important buffs like warrior banners), or healer (often giving boons while also being able to heal allies). Consult `#class_guides` to get a better idea of what support builds we tend to use and what DPS builds we recommend.

3. Gear those builds. Those builds on Snow Crows assume full ascended rarity, but for RTI, a good standard to follow is exotic armour and ascended weapons/trinkets. The most important thing is that the stats, runes, and sigils are correct! Infusions are unimportant. You can find how to get gear [here](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/User:Tanetris/So_You_Want_To_Gear_a_Character).

### Other preparation:
1. Make sure your character's elite specialisation for the chosen build is unlocked. For example, if you choose Power Staff Daredevil as your build, make sure your Thief has the Daredevil specialisation fully unlocked.

2. Make sure you have your masteries all set up. These are the masteries we recommend working towards:

3. Make sure you've practised your build in the [Special Forces Training Area](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Special_Forces_Training_Area). You will find a rotation video and step-by-step guide on the Snow Crows page of your chosen class and build. You will also find class guides at the top of the page that are an immensely helpful resource to guide you through what to do on your class for each boss.

## Joining Your First RTI Raid
1. Every time a new raid is published, a new raid channel is created in the RTI Discord. You can scroll down to the `CURRENT RAIDS` section to see all of our raid channels, with an indicator next to them indicating if they're full (üî¥) or if spots are still open (üîπ). Choose any one of them to view more information about the raid.

2. There will be a message at the top of the channel with information about the raid. Make sure to read this information to see when the raid is happening, check whether you are suitable for the raid, and understand what is expected of you and what you can expect. Most RTI raids come in the form of trainings or kill runs, where the former is suitable for newbies and the latter is suitable for more experienced players.

3. Sign up to the raid by pressing the pencil icon (üìù) at the bottom of the message.

![Raid Signup](https://i.imgur.com/wiFufBQ.png)

4. You will be sent a private message asking you what role to sign up as. Sign up for the role you plan on attending the raid as. If that role is full, you can sign up as reserve and get notified if a spot opens up in the raid, in which case you should sign up for the core role as soon as you can before the spot is taken.

5. On the day and time of the run, if you signed up as a core role and not as a reserve, the commander will ping you with a `/sqjoin` command that you can type in the in-game chatbox and press Enter to join the raid squad.

6. Go into Lion's Arch Aerodrome, join the raid wing instance, and enjoy the RTI raid!

As an additional note, use the `#training_requests` channel in the RTI Discord if you are new to certain raid wings to request them and get priority to join future raid trainings on those wings.

## Tips Any New Raider Should Know
1. When you kill a raid boss, you get its tokens (referred to as "KP"). Keep these! Pugs want to see at LEAST a wing's final boss' KP to gauge your experience level.
2. You can repair your armour in raids at Ley Rifts with the mastery.
3. If you get any spare minis from raid bosses, you can convert them into raid currency at any raid vendor.
4. Opening a raid wing instance will stop you where you left off in that week.
5. If you get someone to open an instance at a particular boss for you, don't load into that instance until they've confirmed that they're loaded in.
6. Doing a raid boss more than once doesn't give more rewards. Every Monday morning, progress on raid bosses is reset and you can get rewards on every boss again.
7. Bind your skills to buttons, including your Special Action Key. Don't skill click!
8. In Graphics Settings, turn up your `Character Model Limit` for raids, set `Shaders` to at least `Medium`, and turn on `Effect LOD`.
9. In General Settings, turn on `Show Skill Recharge`, `Show Target Health Percent`, and `Lock Ground Target at Maximum Skill Range`.
10. In General Settings, disable `Melee Attack Assist` and `Double Tap To Dodge`.
11. `/gg` allows you to quickly suicide without damaging your armour. It's used to reset a raid boss attempt to try again.
12. You can use `/gg` to teleport to the squad upon entering an instance.
13. Turn up effects volume - many attacks in raids have sound cues!
14. Keep track of your mouse cursor in raids. Download [YoloMouse](https://dragonrisegames.com/yolomouse)!
15. If you want to play as DPS, have a condition and power DPS build ready. Many bosses favour power DPS and many others favour condition DPS.
16. Exotic armour has a tiny loss in stats compared to ascended armour. You can get exotic armour of any stat from many areas, such as Bladed armour in Verdant Brink.
17. Check if exotic equipment is salvageable before slotting in expensive runes/sigils. Karma armour or armour from levelling, for example, is not salvageable.
18. Stand tightly in the stack as often as possible. This is where all the boons and healing is!
19. Often, ascended food is cheaper to craft than its exotic counterpart.
20. The 1-hour version of enhancements is much more cost-efficient than the 30-minute variant.
21. You can filter most raid sellers and guilds looking for members from the Raid LFG by entering `-[` into the search bar.
22. Doing Strikes and Fractals nets you currency for ascended gear.
23. The Advanced Logistics mastery gives you access to vendors that are the only way to get your hands on useful food and enhancement recipes.
24. If you miss a ready check and can't ready up, press `P` or click the arrow at the top left of the squad UI and ready up from there.
25. You can stat-swap ascended gear in the Mystic Forge very cheaply, but be careful because you lose your upgrades inside it.
26. There is a red bar indicator below your skills when you're out of range of your target.
27. The [Envoy I collection](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Envoy_Armor_I:_Experimental_Armor) is a great source of ascended armour of any weight of your choosing.
28. The weight you choose in the [Envoy II collection](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Envoy_Armor_II:_Refined_Armor) is what you're stuck with for legendary armour.
29. Know your CC skills and which CC of yours is more impactful. [This](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Defiance_bar) Wiki page helps a lot with that!
30. Many skills, traits, and upgrades rely on you being able to flank the boss. This counts for both being behind the boss and to the side of the boss.
31. On almost all bosses, standing behind the raid boss is recommended to avoid taking unnecessary damage that should only be designated for the tank.
32. Party chat (`/p`) is only visible to people in your squad subgroup. Squad chat (`/d`) is visible to everyone in the squad.
33. Raids have a reputation of being full of toxicity and elitism, but you'll find that this isn't nearly as true as people think. Don't get disheartened!
