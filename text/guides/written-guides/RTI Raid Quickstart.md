## Preparing for Raids

### Gearing up:
1. Choose the class you wish to raid with. All classes in the game are viable with some build or other. Take a look at the `#class_guides` channel in the RTI Discord to get a better idea of what class to go for and what a typical RTI raid class composition looks like.

2. Choose a build to use for your class on [Snow Crows](https://www.snowcrows.com/). Builds broadly fall under categories of DPS (damage-oriented), boon support (giving important boons like quickness/might or important buffs like warrior banners), or healer (often giving boons while also being able to heal allies). Consult `#class_guides` to get a better idea of what support builds we tend to use and what DPS builds we recommend.

3. Gear those builds. Those builds on Snow Crows assume full ascended rarity, but for RTI, a good standard to follow is exotic armour and ascended weapons/trinkets. The most important thing is that the stats, runes, and sigils are correct! Infusions are unimportant. You can find how to get gear [here](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/User:Tanetris/So_You_Want_To_Gear_a_Character).

### Other preparation:
1. Make sure your character's elite specialisation for the chosen build is unlocked. For example, if you choose Power Staff Daredevil as your build, make sure your Thief has the Daredevil specialisation fully unlocked.
2. Make sure you have your masteries all set up. These are the masteries we recommend working towards:

3. Make sure you've practised your build in the [Special Forces Training Area](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Special_Forces_Training_Area). You will find a rotation video and step-by-step guide on the Snow Crows page of your chosen class and build.

## Joining Your First RTI Raid
1. Every time a new raid is published, a new raid channel is created in the RTI Discord. You can scroll down to the `CURRENT RAIDS` section to see all of our raid channels, with an indicator next to them indicating if they're full (üî¥) or if spots are still open (üîπ). Choose any one of them to view more information about the raid.

2. There will be a message at the top of the channel with information about the raid. Make sure to read this information to see when the raid is happening, check whether you are suitable for the raid, and understand what is expected of you and what you can expect.

3. Sign up to the raid by pressing the pencil icon (üìù) at the bottom of the message.

4. You will be sent a private message asking you what role to sign up as. Sign up for the role you plan on attending the raid as. If that role is full, you can sign up as reserve and get notified if a spot opens up in the raid, in which case you should sign up for the core role as soon as you can before the spot is taken.

5. On the day and time of the run, if you signed up as a core role and not as a reserve, the commander will ping you with a `/sqjoin` command that you can type in the in-game chatbox and press Enter to join the raid squad.

6. Enjoy the RTI raid!

As an additional note, use the `#training_requests` channel in the RTI Discord if you are new to certain raid wings to request them and get priority to join future raid trainings on those wings.
